# Requirements Conflict Resolution

## Issue Resolved
A conflict was identified between two requirements files:
- `requirements.txt` (49 dependencies, newer versions)
- `requirements_secure.txt` (85 dependencies, security-focused versions)

## Resolution
1. **Merged Dependencies**: Combined both files into a unified `requirements.txt` that includes:
   - Latest versions for enhanced functionality (where safe)
   - Security-focused versions for packages with known vulnerabilities
   - All security tools and libraries from the secure requirements
   - Clear comments explaining security considerations

2. **Legacy File**: Renamed `requirements_secure.txt` to `requirements_secure_legacy.txt` to preserve history while avoiding confusion.

3. **Benefits of Resolution**:
   - Single source of truth for dependencies
   - Maintains security focus while enabling latest features
   - Eliminates version conflicts during installation
   - Includes comprehensive security tooling

## Key Security Updates Preserved
- urllib3>=2.5.0 (Fixed CVE-2024-37891, CVE-2025-50181, CVE-2025-50182)
- jinja2>=3.1.6 (Fixed multiple CVEs)
- PyJWT>=2.10.1 (Fixed CVE-2024-53861)
- certifi>=2024.8.30 (Fixed CVE-2024-39689)
- twisted>=24.7.0 (Fixed CVE-2024-41810)

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This unified approach ensures both functionality and security are maintained without conflicts.
